// Agenda: Module 1 Part 7

// Software Engineering

// When we think of engineering, we think of building cars or buildings, and less
// about something as virtual as software. But software is as intricate as any other
// discipline out there.
// Designing the wrong software, or designing the software wrong, can lead to
// catastrophic consequences.
// The same way you can learn to lay bricks to make a house, you can learn
// programming to make simple applications, but can you make a skyscraper you
// are sure is not going to fall? That’s the role of a software engineer!

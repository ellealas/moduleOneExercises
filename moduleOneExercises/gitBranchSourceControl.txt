Git – branch source control


Create a new branch called feat1 

use the command 
    git branch feat1 
    or 
    via VSCode - click the ‘main’ branch in the bottom left corner:



In your branch, do the add and commit routine again, like you did in
the previous one.

Now you have created another point in time. 

Let’s assume you have
finished your feature, and you are ready to put it back into main.
Switch into the main branch, and then run the command 
    git merge feat1
this will merge the code together. 


Congratulations, you have
completed your first feature branch.
Remember, this is still just local, you now push the main back into
the remote, so you can share it with your team.

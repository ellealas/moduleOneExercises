// Definition : Packages

// When we create applications, we rarely build all of it. In fact, we
// mostly rely on pre-existing packages. A developer’s main job is to
// almost “fill in the gaps”, building complex applications come from
// experience, and that experience translates into architectural
// patterns and packages. For example, we do not need to make our
// own sentiment analysis functionalities. Other people did it before,
// and we can just borrow it.

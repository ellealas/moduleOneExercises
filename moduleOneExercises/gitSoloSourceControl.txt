Git – solo source control
Go into the folder you just created after the cloning.
If you haven’t created a README at creation, create one now, if
you did create it, just open it. Make some changes, and save the
file.



Run the command 
    git status

it will tell you that the file has been
modified. If you created it, it will say it is not tracked.

Run the command 
    git add . 

this will add all the files to current
commit, and will track them.

Run the command 
    git commit –m “write something here” 

this willcreate a set moment in time. At this moment, your repos are now
out of sync. Your local is ahead.



Because your local and remote repos are out of sync, if
someone else were to clone the remote repo, we would be in
trouble. Also, if our machine were to die, we would be in
trouble.
So the next step is to push the code back to the remote.

Once we are happy with the commits, we just need to 
run the command 
    git push

If this is the first time you run it, you will
get prompt to update the remote, you can just copy and paste
message to fix it.
After pushing, the remote and local will be back in sync.

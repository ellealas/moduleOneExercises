<!-- HTML - Hyperlinks

If the pages are hyper, then links should be too! Hyperlinks
are links to other pages, not just online, but anywhere that
can be mapped through the network. This is normally a page
URL, for example, www.google.com. 
The <a> tag, also referred to as the “anchor” tag, is an html primitive,
meaning it has a predefined behavior, for example, most
browsers will make it blue and underlined.
We create an anchor tag in the following way. -->

<a href="https://google.com">Click here!</a>

<!-- The <a></a> tag is the element.
The href attribute indicates the link's destination.
As mentioned some behaviors are inbuilt. For example, it
already has a click event, so clicking it will take you to your
destination. -->

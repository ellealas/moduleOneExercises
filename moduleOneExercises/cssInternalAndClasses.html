<!-- CSS â€“ Internal and classes

The second way is to create classes and keep these classes
inside a reserved space. A class is a description that we
attach to an element. An element can have many classes
associated. This way, we can write a class one time, but
apply it to many elements. We will come back to classes
later. Here we change the global classes of the elements,
like H1. In this way, we can keep our work cleaner, and we
have a single place where we can change things.
This is one step closer, but still, not something you should
use except for personal work. -->

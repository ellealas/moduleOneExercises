<!-- CSS

CSS gives our web pages the look and feel, the colours, the structure,
the behavior, even animations. Most of the things related to anything
visual about our page comes from CSS.
CSS is added to HTML elements in a number of ways, and most of the
time, they define things such as the colour. For example, the following
indicates that this specific div will have red background colour. -->

<div style="background-color:red"></div>

<!-- CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways​:
Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements​
Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section​
External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file -->

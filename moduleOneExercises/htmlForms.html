<!-- HTML - Forms

The HTML form is another important primitive, but this
will require that you understand more complex
concepts, such as internet methods (HTTP methods) to
fully understand and appreciate. For now, you can take
for granted the following.
- The Form takes the data within it and stores it into a
network package.
- Upon clicking the submit button, it will send the
data to the url described in the action attribute.
This functionality has evolved over time, but it is still as
used today as when it was created in the 90s. -->

If you click the "Submit" button, the form-
data will be sent to a page called "/action_pag

e". -->

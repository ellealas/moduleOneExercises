Definition - JavaScript

JavaScript is the programming language of the Web, used both on
client-side and server-side.
For client-side: HTML and CSS give structure and style to web
pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage

a user.
For the server-side: it's just like C# or Java, but the syntax is
JavaScript. A good example of this is NodeJS. -->

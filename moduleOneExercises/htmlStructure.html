<!-- HTML - Structure

HTML uses the concept of Tags – these tags can be nested into one
another, and together, they form the document. All tags (except for
a few exceptions) are opened and closed, meaning that inner
content is limited to within that tag. Here we have some examples.
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5
document​
The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page​
The <head> element contains meta information about the page
The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in
the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)​
The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all
the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks,
tables, lists, etc.​
The <div> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.​
The <h1> element defines a large heading​
The <p> element defines a paragraph​  -->

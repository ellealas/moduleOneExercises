<!-- HTML - Elements

These tags delimit what we call HTML element, and it is
everything from the start tag to the end tag​. Elements are
also defined by their class, which is a styling property we
will explore later. -->

<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>
<div>Content goes here...</div>
<p>Content goes here...</p>

<!-- We can also build our elements in a nested way, for
example, if we wanted to build an area with two areas
within it, we would do something along these lines.

The major advantage, but also disadvantage, is the
communication cost. By doing this, we do not need to “scan
a picture” or written document, we can create complex
documents with a few bytes of code. -->

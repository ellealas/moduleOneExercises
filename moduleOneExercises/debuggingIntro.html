<!-- Debugging demystified

Debugging is the art of finding bugs in your
software, there are a number of ways to go around
doing this, and every developer should know at
least the basics.
Writing good code comes from paying attention to
the code itself. Errors happen because we have the
logic wrong or we simply made a typo.
Remember, computers are machines, they don’t act
randomly.

Types of debugging

• Console debugging
• IDE level debugging
• Browser level debugging






Browser Inspector

If you are using Chrome, or Edge, or Safari, or
Mozilla, you should have access to the inspector
mode – or developer mode.
You can use this to “inspect” the page. You can do

this by pressing ctrl + shift + i or simply right-
clicking on the browser anywhere, and clicking inspect.

Exercise

Learning to use the inspector
window is vital to finding
problems, and making
corrections on the fly.
Explore this window and find
the tab “console”
Everytime you use the
console.log command,
messages will be displayed
here.
Spend some time finding more
information about the network
tab and the Elements tab, try
clicking on items on a page,
they will be highlighted in the
rendering window. Try to
change the values! -->


<!-- Debugging demystified

The basic debugging can be done using console
logs. There are various logging levels available such
as
console.debug( ) : outputs a message to the
console with the log level debug
console.info( ) : is used to output message which
provide information, such as “server started”
console.warn( ): used to display warnings
console.error() : is used to output an error
message. You may use string substitution and
additional arguments with this method.
These will help you find mistakes faster.


Exercise
Include the following in the
script of an html page and run
it in the live server -->

<html>
<head>
<title>Hello World</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Hello World!!!</h1>
<script>
console.log('this is a Message');
console.info('this is info');
console.warn('this is a warning');
console.error('this is an error');
</script>

</body>
</html> 


<!-- Breakpoints

When you reload, the renderer will
stop at exactly that moment.
Check the console, you can verify
that it has not passed the breakpoint.
Run it in the live server and open the
inspector window.
At the top, there is a little window,
with two actions, Resume and Step
Over. Resume will continue with no
more stops. Step Over instead, will
advance the code by one line. -->

<!-- Breakpoints

Using the code from the previous page, run it in live
server and open the inspector window.
Go to the tab “Sources”, here you will see a tree
structure with your page as well.

Scroll down the code to find the console.log section,
click just left of the second call, it will bring up a red
dot, this is a breakpoint.
Reload the page! -->

<!-- This technique is the most common
way of debugging applications. On
the right you have a column with all
the machine state. Don’t worry, it is
early for you to understand that part
yet, we will get to it! -->

<!-- HTML - Tables

When dealing with the “interpretation” part of the
browsers, you may find that behavior is not always
consistent, and things may not appear as you
planned, but there is one structure which is always
risk-free, the Table. The Table tag allows you to create
tabular structure which is fixed and highly
customisable. If you need consistency, this is the way
to go. Experiment using the table.
The <table> tag defines an HTML table.
• Each table row is defined with a <tr> tag.
• Each table header is defined with a <th> tag.
• Each table data/cell is defined with a <td> tag.
• By default, the text in <th> elements are bold and
centered. -->

<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <th>Row 1 column 1</th>
        <th>Row 1 column 2</th>
        <th>Row 1 column 3</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Row 2 column 1</td>
        <td>Row 2 column 2</td>
        <td>Row 2 column 3</td>
    </tr>

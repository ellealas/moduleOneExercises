// Node Package Manager

// npm (originally short for Node Package Manager) is a package
// manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js
// maintained by npm, Inc.
// It consists of a command line client, also called npm, and an
// online database of public and paid-for private packages, called
// the npm registry.
// The registry is accessed via the client, and the available
// packages can be browsed and searched via the npm website.
// Written entirely in JavaScript and was developed by Isaac Z.
// Schlueter. Released in 2010.
// Over 10 million users in 2018.
// Open-source.

// While it is important to learn
// to write complex code, we also
// need to learn to leverage what
// is already out there.

// Go on the npm website, and
// try to get a feeling for it.
// Putting them together to form
// an application is an intricate
// puzzle.

// Exercise
// Find three packages on NPM
// that you could use to build
// some application.



// Usage

// • NPM can manage packages that are local
// dependencies of a particular project, as well as
// globally-installed JavaScript tools.
// • All the dependencies of a project through the
// package.json file.
// • It allows users to consume and distribute JavaScript
// modules that are available in the registry.
// • We can use packages published by others.
// • We can publish packages for others to use.


// Tha package.json file is used to
// keep track of packages we use
// locally. The part called
// dependencies, are all the
// packages downloaded and
// managed through NPM, it is
// not abnormal to have 99% of
// an application made up of
// packages, and not our own
// code.

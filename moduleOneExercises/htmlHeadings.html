<!-- HTML - Headings

Heading elements, with other primitives, are some of
the most basic building blocks. They are elements
which have some predefined styles. Like any other
element, they can be restyled manually.

Remember, HTML was first created in the 90s. Back
then, communication costs were extreme. For this
reason we had premade styles, so that people could
create documents without transferring styles as well. -->

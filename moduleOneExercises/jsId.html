<!-- JavaScript – Change the
document elements

In this example, we demonstrate how we can go and
manipulate CSS to change how things look and feel. For
example we could make a link change colour after it is
clicked, or make an image zoom in while the user is
hoovering on it with the mouse. JS is extremely
versatile.
In this example, we also meet the concept of id. So far,
we only used generic elements, but elements can have
an id, so we can recognise them, and change only the
ones we are interested in.
In this case, we want to change the colour of the
element which has an id of “demo”. The function you
see goes through the document searching for an
element of id demo and when it finds it, it changes the
style colour to red. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<!--
this demo will change the text colour to red
. -->
<h1>JavaScript Change style Demo</h1>
<p id="demo">JavaScript can change the style
of an HTML element.</p>
<script>
document.getElementById("demo").style.color
= "red";
</script>
</body>
</html>

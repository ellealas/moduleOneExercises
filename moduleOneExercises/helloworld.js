// Write some Node

// First of all, from Part 1, check that you have Node
// running. You can do this by opening the command
// prompt, or PowerShell, or terminal and run the
// command node â€“version. If this goes well, you should
// see some numbers.

// Create a new folder, give it a memorable name, and
// then cd into it.
// Use the command code . to open Visual studio code.
// Create a file called helloworld.js
// Insert the following content and save it.

console.log('Hello World')

// It is time to test your first
// helloworld program.
// The simplest way is to run it
// using the following command
// node helloworld.js in the
// terminal, from where the file is
// stored. If everything goes well,
// you should be able to see the "Hello World!" 
// in the terminal

// To change the code, after
// changing, save it, close the

// current process by doing CTRL-
// C or Command-C twice . You

// have to do this manually every
// time, unfortunately, until you
// start using packages.

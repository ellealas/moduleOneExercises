Git â€“ Creating a repo online
A repo, or a repository, is a synchronised version of your code.
We call remote the one which is on GitHub, and we call local
the one which is on your machine. We use GitHub to store our
code, share it with the world, and also, to share it with our
teams. We synchronise through pull and pushes. When we
request code from the remote, we call it a pull. When instead,
we upload code from our local machine, we call it a push.
Expert users will know how to manage code straight from their
machines, but for us, we will begin by creating the repository
online.

Navigate to https://github.com/new and create a repo. Give it
a name, and follow the prompt to initialise it.
One created, you will be able to clone the online repository
locally.

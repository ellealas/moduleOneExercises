Git – cloning the repo
The first time we make a local copy of the repo, we call the action a clone, as we are
cloning the remote into the local.
Open a terminal and use the command:
git clone urloftheremoterepo
And this will make a perfect local copy.
You can also use VSCode for this: use the shortcut Ctrl-Shift-P, then type ‘git’ to find
the Git: Clone command:

Git is the window to the soul of every
developer. If you apply for a job, you can
expect people to look up your git repository.

Click Git: Clone then paste in the link for your new repository. VSCode will ask where to
store your remote repo on your local computer, then ask if you want to open a new
window - choose this option.

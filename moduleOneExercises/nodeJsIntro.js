// Definition : NodeJS

// Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code
// outside of a browser. It literally changed the way we develop
// because it took down a huge barrier in web development.
// Normally, developers would be divided into frontend (html and Js)
// and backend, (Java / .net) . NodeJS allowed for the use of JS in both
// front and backend, making it simple and fast to become “Full Stack
// Developers”. It hit 1.2 billion downloads in 2018 (Medium), used by
// at least 20 million sites (W3Tech).



// Application Programming Interface (API)

// Here are some terms that you need to learn to become a web developer.
// API (and SDKs)
// An API is a set of defined rules that explain how computers or applications
// communicate with one another. APIs sit between an application and the web
// server, acting as an intermediary layer that processes data transfer between
// systems.
// REST (Representational State Transfer):
// Architecture style for designing networked applications, relies on a stateless,
// client-server protocol, almost always HTTP.
// RESTful APIs:
// APIs that are constructed based on REST architecture, and usually use HTTP
// methods.



// Basic Architecture for Rest

// REST based APIs are the most common
// types of web services now in the market.
// NodeJS made it extremely simple to
// generate one through the use of Express, a
// framework for web services and web
// servers.
// In its simplest form, a REST server has
// endpoints available to be consumed,
// serving web pages is one clear example of
// this.



// Popular Node Backend Framework

// Here is a list of the most well-known frameworks, and a good starting
// point for every developer.
// Express.js – rapid server-side programming.
// Socket.io – building real-time apps and establishing bidirectional
// communication between web clients and servers.
// Hapi.js – developing proxy servers, and REST APIs and other desktop
// applications since the framework is reliable and rich in its security
// aspects.

// Benefit of using NodeJS

// • Great for prototyping and agile.
// • Highly scalable and fast to build.

// • Use JavaScript - front-end developers can pick up easily => full-
// stack developer.

// • Cleaner code base from front to back (both use JavaScript).
// • Large open-source libs and supported by many services.
// • Most programming paradigms are shifting to JS, for example
// Tensorflow, one of the most important AI frameworks, is moving
// from Python to NodeJS



// Big companies use NodeJS

// Most large companies out there make use of NodeJS, its versatility
// make it one of the most flexible programming languages for the
// industry. Here is just a short list of some of the companies that do
// use NodeJS in their main infrastructure.
// • LinkedIn
// • Netflix
// • NASA
// • PayPal

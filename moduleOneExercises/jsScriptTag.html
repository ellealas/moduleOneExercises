<!-- JavaScript â€“ Script tag

The HTML <script> tag is used to define a client-side script
(JavaScript). When we refer to client side, we always
mean what is available to the user through the web
browser.
The <script> element either contains script statements, or
it points to an external script file through the src
attribute, similar to how we do CSS or images.
In this example, we use JavaScript to execute a simple
alert action. JavaScript (JS) is executed how it is read. In
this case, the machine will read the content from top to
bottom. When it find a JS part, it will execute it. In this
case, it will execute this alert. -->

: -->

</script>
</body>
</html>

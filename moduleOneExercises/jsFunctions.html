<!-- JavaScript â€“ functions

Now we can look at how we can create a button to
activate a function. A function is a piece of code which
gets executed only when it is called. In this case, the
function is called by the click of a button we created. The
button itself has an attribute onclick, this is a special
attribute, which is for adding resolution to specific events,
in this case, when it is clicked.
Our function helloWorld will pop up a message when the
button is clicked. The button itself, is an html primitive. It
is a special element with premade behaviors, in this case,
behaving like a button. -->
